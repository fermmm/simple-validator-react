# SIMPLE-VALIDATOR-REACT

This is a visual implementation of simple-validator for React. Is a wrapper of ```<input>``` native tag that adds the error message, also adds the underline under the error text and implements autocorrect.

The ```<input>``` tag can be replaced with the input component from your favorite UI library changing that line in the file InputWrapper.jsx

## Getting started

1) clone the repository

2) run ```npm install```

3) run ```npm run start```

That opens a sandbox webpage where you can test the validator in the browser.
