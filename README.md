# SIMPLE-VALIDATOR-REACT

This is a visual implementation of simple-validator for React. It's a component that wraps ```<input>``` native tag adding the error message, problem underline and autocorrect.

The ```<input>``` tag can be replaced with the input component from your favorite UI library.

There is an example using Material UI TextField.

## Getting started

1) clone the repository

2) run ```npm install```

3) run ```npm run start```

That opens a sandbox webpage where you can test the validator in the browser.

## Known bugs:

Underline glitch when the input text gets scroller vertically or horizontally.
